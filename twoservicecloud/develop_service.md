# Developing the Multiplier Service

Make sure that you went through [Initializing the Project](init.md) tutorial, so that you can develop the Multiplier service you have created there.

The development is broken into shorter, easier to comprehend, steps:

1. [Expose the `multiply` method on the `user` role](add_method.md)
2. [Listen to the Config Service](listentoconfig.md)
3. [Use the remote multiplier value](useremotemultiplier.md)
